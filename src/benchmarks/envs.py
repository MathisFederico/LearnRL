class TurnEnv(Env):

    r"""Turn based multi-agents gym environment.

    A layer over the gym |gym.Env| class able to handle
    turn based environments with multiple agents.

    .. note::
        A :ref:`TurnEnv` must be in a :ref:`Playground` in order to work !

    The only add in TurnEnv is the method "turn",
    On top of the main API basic methodes (see |gym.Env|):
        * step: take a step of the |gym.Env| given the action of the active player
        * reset: reset the |gym.Env| and returns the first observation
        * render
        * close
        * seed

    Attributes:
        action_space (|gym.Space|): The Space object corresponding to actions.
        observation_space (|gym.Space|): The Space object corresponding to observations.
