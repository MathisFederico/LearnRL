About LearnRL
-------------

| LearnRL is a library to use and learn reinforcement learning.
| Look how easy it is to use:

.. code-block:: python

   import learnrl as rl
   from learnrl.environments import CrossesAndNoughtsEnv
   from learnrl.agents import StandardAgent

   env = CrossesAndNoughtsEnv()
   agent1 = StandardAgent(state_space=env.observation_space, action_space=env.action_space)
   agent2 = StandardAgent(state_space=env.observation_space, action_space=env.action_space)

   agents = [agent1, agent2]
   pg = rl.Playground(env, agents)
   pg.fit(50000, verbose=1)

And boom you made two QLearning AIs training against each other on crosses and noughts !
