About LearnRL
-------------

LearnRL is a framework to use and learn reinforcement learning with a wandb integration for a good visualisation !
Our motto is clean, sharable and readable Agents !
As such, you can plug and play agents on any environment, but also look how agents are built to learn !

Also, LearnRL is cross platform compatible ! That's why no agents are built-in learnrl itself, but you can check:
   - `LearnRL for Tensorflow <https://github.com/MathisFederico/LearnRL-Tensorflow>`_
   - `LearnRL for Pytorch <https://github.com/MathisFederico/LearnRL-Pytorch>`_
